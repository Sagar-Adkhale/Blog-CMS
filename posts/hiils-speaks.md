Day1

The first day of the tour started early by 4 am so that we can get out of the city by 6 am and avoid city traffic. We hit the highways around 6 am and kicked in riding gears. Since road to Kerala from Coimbatore is slight a downhill, we peddled at speed 27-29kmph. The whole reason for this to achieve our day 1 target of 250Km.

However, once we turned towards our first milestone which is Athirapally waterfalls which was some 30 km from the town of Chalakudy our average speed came down 21-23kmph because of hills and ascents. The road from Chalakudy runs beside Chalakudy river, we took the opportunity to take dip in the flowing river. After visiting the falls, we headed ahead and took forest route. We stopped at area Perumbavoor by riding 230km and called the day.

Day2

Since we were short on day by 20km which means we had to start early to cover the distance. We had done close to 5km Kerala when wonderful rains took over us, nevertheless we rode in rains until it became impossible to ride. Eventually we realized the rains are not going to stop so let’s just get going. The advantage of rains is body recovers while riding and disadvantage is the bags on bike everything becomes heavy because of getting wet.

Any which ways last 50km was good climbs to Munnar area. We had our breakfast at small shack on route to Munnar after doing almost a climb of 15k. While we were closing on Munnar and when it was just 7km left to reach, the rain gods came up with a plan of showering us with heavy downpour. Our plan was to cross Munnar and reach a place called Marayoor. At this point of time we realized that it would be impossible to reach Marayoor, so we focused on the restaurant in front of us serving hot Biryani and other Kerala dishes. After 2 hours when rain subsided, we continued and ended our ride in Munnar with a good tea.

Day 3

The day started with climbs right away from the place where we stayed. After 2 days of riding hard starting off with climb can be challenging but the views just gave us the right motivation to push through. There is famous road knows as Gap Road which is from Munnar to Poppara. After in and around Nilgiris and western ghats I can say that this route will provide you the best views ever. Once at Poppara, we took the road towards the famous destination Thekkady(Kumily). At this point we were already riding at an elevation 1000m with some dense forest around. The beauty of this Route was there are just waterfalls all over 100kms. If you are thirsty drink in, tired then just dip in.

Eventually by 4.30 we reached Kumily and continued towards downhill which gets you to Tamilnadu. My rear brakes failed while 3 kms in downhill and then I had run the rest of 3km which was fun as well.

At this point we were tired, my bike had break issues and then was still 45 kms away. We continued after a short tea break and just kept riding hard. However, when we were just 20kms away again rains started. Considering we were on highway in dark we took a break and lost another 30 min like that. There were lots of ups and down on this day. But the ups of the ride really uplifted our morale. For example, a group of kids excited to see our bikes and us, A gentleman inviting us at home for water, A young student rode with us on highway in dark to lead us safely for good 10kms.
