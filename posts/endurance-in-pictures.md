R﻿oute - 225km

T﻿his route is particularly good for good spinning there are no real hills, its just a long route, and the very first 50-60 km is quite a rolling road. As usual  started early morning around 5.15am. The only reason to start early is cover the some good distance before sun is up. But it turned out to be a rainy day along with heavy winds. It's a fun in itself to ride in rains .

T﻿here was no specific goal of riding , we were headed to a dam named meenkara which is in Kerala. After crossing around 60 odd kms , we were on the road which just had trees (refer the image below). It's a sin for a cyclist to not ride on such roads.
