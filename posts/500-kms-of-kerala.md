K﻿erala and intriguing place as always attracts lot of tourists and local population to its wilderness. I am no different than the lot, apart from just being on a cycle. I have been going around Kerala for last 4 years. The more I visit the place the more I love the place. I have liked this place for many reasons and tourism is probably now last. There is acceptance for everyone, People have respect towards forest , you would not find garbage randomly, Basic education is way better than anywhere in country. There is definitely a stronger civic sense in people, lot of traditions which people have tried keeping it alive. 

This was not really tour , just biking and going through Forests, rivers ,towns, cities and Beach.
