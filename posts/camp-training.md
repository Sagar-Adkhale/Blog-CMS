The camp concept training is more around fixed period of time ranging from 1-3 months . These trainings are generally around specific sports. By the end of the camp training a significant improvement in the performance of the Athlete can be observed. For example if its basketball – Vertical jumps, ball handling skills will improve etc . If its Athletics speed improvements can be experienced.
Methodology of camp trainings are on very simple principles

1. Whichever sport it is do it more to get better
2. Rest and Recover at faster rate
3. Nutrition are basic – No fancy stuff required- No need to be calculative of calories , type of food etc..

   Can this methodology be twisted and implemented by working professionals and improve to become better ? The answer is very much **YES**

Therefore I created a routine for myself for the month of September, However I didn’t created the whole month schedule in one go. There is no hard and fast rule that the whole month has to be planned, but there has to be some basic principles which will define your weekly schedule. Below were the some of the basic principles I followed

* 2 workout sessions in a day or one session equivalent to 2 session effort
* My focus is always Running and cycling so the schedule should incorporate more of it in terms of mileage and type of training
* For Running- 1 (Flat/track/road) speed sessions or Hills sprint session at least in a week
* For Cycling – Either 1 endurance session or Hill session
* Incorporate strength sessions which are required for bettering the sport intended
* Even tired ,stick to the schedule – The trick to do that is improve your recovery
* Have a must Rest day

Segment 3 started with a light 20km cycling because I could not ride more. To compensate for the loss ,I had Table tennis game during evening. This segment had good sessions around speed work.

If you notice I have missed some principles defined earlier of the article, like having multiple sessions , every week one speed session. But consciously I have tried to compensate the same in subsequent days. It’s important here to keep putting effort to stay consistent to the plan else desired results will not be achieved.

The speed work was very conservative in nature wherein I had put a limit a range of pace to clock which would be 4-4.05 min/km with rest period 2.50. However, I did clocked 3 different intervals with time of 3.54, 3.51 and 3.45.

The subsequent day was followed by a 40 Km cycling to get some recovery and with some strength session in evening. The next day was easy Long run of 20 km. Followed the next day running with skating and Table tennis. Monday started with speed work totalling to 10km , details in the table.

In this speed work the motive was to keep minimal rest period between intervals. I had kept it to 30-40 s.

During the last segment of the Training I was travelling to hills for a vacation. So I had thought of training in the hills at least 1 session. Started with long slow trail run of 15km at very easy pace. Also, I managed to do some speed session on the hills.

With this I ended the part 1 of the camp training workout mode. The next few days the training will be on but not in very objective or goal oriented mode. However, I will publish the details in the part 2 of the same.

 Output of this Part resulted in below

* Good Endurance to run long distance
* Mental preparedness to run long distance
* Improvement in 10km timing without doing lot of speed work
* Vo2 Max increase from 52 -54 (This number can change based on the rest period as well)

This whole section can also be considered as base building phase. During this phase the athlete brings body in correct conditioning, endurance with respect to the sport. The next phase will include building specifics of the sport , For me it would be working on speed , Form , Posture , breathing etc.
