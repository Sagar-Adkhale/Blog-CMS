I﻿ had always wanted to do a tour around Nilgiris and Ride the hills. . The 3 day-route we had planned was  **Coimbatore-Kotagiri- Ooty , Ooty-Gudalur-Wayanad - Omasery-mukkam-Manarkkad-coimbatore.** 

T﻿he total distance of the tour was around 460km with an elevation gain of 6000m.

**Day 1**

Day 1 initial plan was to pass Ooty by afternoon and reach Gudalur. This would be around 150km distance and reduce the load for next day where we had planned to pass waynad and enter plains of kerala which would be again 2000m of Elevation.

Myself, Shravanan and Karthik started early morning as planned. But things were about to change, and Plans were about to fail. The climb to ooty was 60 km uphill via the route which we took. Karthik was first to get hit by heat amongst us thereby he suggested us to go ahead. I and shravanan took off from that point, but just 5km in ride we had a major problem with Shravanan bike. We were not able fix derailleur and had to swap the bike with Karthik’s bike.

Eventually all drama concluded, and we took off to Ooty but it was already 12 and it was still 25km uphill riding to be finished to Ooty. We were lucky to meet two of my friends and colleagues Daniel and babu suresh (Can be seen above in PIC). Daniel helped us with stay in the peak season

Now we reached Ooty around 3.30 pm. After refreshing it was already 5pm. The greater challenge was to find a place to stay in peak season and it 

**Day 2**

After a good night sleep, we started our next day with objective of reaching a place called Mukkam which was 200km away from Ooty. Good day this was, scenic route going through forests, no traffic, small hamlets and good tea on small stalls. We had crossed Waynad(hill station in kerala) at 1pm and were in quite good shape. Post our lunch we started getting down from wayand. Now we had passed all hilly routes, and now it would be just cruising road to Mukkam -that’s what we thought. However, this was about to change. 

kerala is at altitude of -20m with almost no flat road. The whole route to mukkam was Rolling route with gradient of 11-13% (As per our Cylcometers).

And this day as well we had to end the ride at a place called as omasery, 30km short from Mukkam. With this day the hope of having an easy 3rd day was gone as well. Anyways day 2 ended with 170km in terms of mileage and we were in kerala.

**Day 3**

We were already in mindset that it would be long day, but it will be just more distance no other challenges like Route, bike, weather etc. We also tweaked our initial route which passed through some high gradient ascends and descends. So technically if one is fit enough, you will do just fine. Anyways there was something else in store. We had puncture in one bike around 11.30, unfortunately we could not fix it. Therefore, to get that fixed we had to go to a bike shop which was on 5km mark of our initial route of climbs. All this consumed close to 1.5hr for us and the temperature has already touched 37-38 degrees.

Now we were so stuck that we decided to ride till Palakkad which was 60-70km from that point and then only have lunch. We rode, struggled but managed to reach Palakkad in evening, we had so much of crunch in time, that we decided to get out of Palakkad reach highway and then had our lunch. Finally after having lunch between 5-6 pm, we started for coimbatore. We were already riding hard when we faced thunderstorms on way to coimbatore which made us to retreat at walyar. We almost called the day off and were thinking of other ideas, however we started ride again around 8.30 and reached coimbatore at 10pm.
