I have been a cyclist with more inclination towards bikepacking and Touring. This summer I had planned a one week Tour. The route went through the major hill stations across Tamilnadu and kerala.

After 1st day of the ride my encounter for next 4 days was going to be with different hill stations. Vagamon hills was the first on the route, which was going well, until I hit last 7kms. With a gradient of 15% and temperature of 37 degrees one gets physically broken and then it takes you mentally. I walked most of last 4kms to reach at top.

The next day was going to be great, my body has adjusted with the hills , heat etc. An Early morning start and sighting of Deers crossing in front of me gave me some experience.

Today the distance was going to be less but absolute no Flat roads to ride. This day started with going through a downhill of 20km through forest. Lot of cashews I found in the surroundings and that was my breakfast. I met so many people on the ride who were just excited to hear about this attempt, and some went out of their way to offer me food, stay.

Hills are always difficult, it is just some are less difficult some are more difficult, but its never easy. 

The next day started with me being absolutely physically fit and recovered. Today target was to cross 2 different hill stations Munnar and Bodimettu. Munnar is tourist attraction having visitors across the world . Tourism is good business , but projects of road widening on Hills have definitely taken out the greenery along the road. 

Anyways I crossed Munnar and headed to Bodimettu . All of sudden there was thunderstorms and rain due to which i took a night halt at Bodimettu hills.

It was quite peaceful here.

Next day I wanted to conclude the ride by reaching coimbatore, but it demanded me to ride 270km. All these days of Riding in heat and rain gave me saddle sores which were quite painful. I started with intention of concluding the ride, but after 2hrs in ride and some 50 odd kms I realised I will have to ride late evening also to finish.

Luckily, at this point of time I also saw a board which said Kodaikanal 60km( it’s a another hill station of Tamilnadu). I automatically took the turn and went on climbing this hill station. I spotted lot of Giant squirrels apart from lot of People/cars. Good climbs, until I reached the destination and then called the day off.

The 6th day I concluded the ride by riding back to coimbatore. It took me some time to come out of the tour mindset. Lot of learning as a cyclist and good interactions throughout the ride.
