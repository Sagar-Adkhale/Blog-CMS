I have been lately off with physical activity eventually leading to, me being out of shape. And itâ€™s not at all a good feeling. Also, I have been visiting Coimbatore for official work and trying to get my head around the city. Coimbatore is a city where, at least it looks that Industrial development and Nature are trying to survive together. It has its own challenges though. Coimbatore location per se has an advantage of having weather which is cycling friendly as compared to Mumbai and there are good areas to go cycling.

How much ever attractive, cycling may look or sound (considering the costly gears in sport nowadays), no one can take away the need of practice to execute long rides. An area can be peaceful and rider can be philosophical but without practice you (at least Me) will end in a zone where you will not really appreciate the surrounding, you will feel the temperature rise, and the long road ahead. A single uphill will be a killer, forget about big climbs.

Hence forth to build the endurance and get back to training, I went ahead in identifying some routes which can be used on daily basis for training. Coimbatore is a city where in single ride of 20km will take you out of the city. At the same time the city has lot of good inroads which connects different areas and generally devoid of traffic. Within these roads one can make some good training routes from 20km-50km. I have been successful in identifying few routes and have also found fellow riders.

Here are few pictures from around.
