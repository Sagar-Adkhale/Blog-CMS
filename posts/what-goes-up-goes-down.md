I have been cycling regularly and have also met of couple of regular riders in coimbatore. It’s been a while, the thought of Riding uphill in mountains is very fascinating ,and after my visit to **coonoor- ooty**, I was convinced to go for a ride in Nilgiris. I consulted with Karthik and told him my ride plan. Not only he gave me pointers he also joined for the ride upto a certain distance. We planned to ride early in morning around 5 am from Thudiyalur junction so that we go easy and also have time at our side.

**Thudiyalur** to **Metupalayam** was easy spin, along with some conversations eventually leading Karthik to change his plan and accompany me till Burliyar (kind of first milestone on the coonoor Climb). **Burliyar** is 6km away from base of the foothills and it certainly gives you idea what to expect further from that point.

Hills are always hurting irrespective how fit you are. I continued from Burliyar to Coonoor. At this moment I am pumped up, riding slowly but steadily enjoying the views ,thinking next stop to be directly **coonoor.** Then I notice the distance covered so far , it’s just little more than 2km from Burliyar. Coonoor is still 15km away better leave the thought of being the ***“Hero in the town”*** and just take break whenever needed.

So here I am at coonoor happily under impression that I have crossed the difficult part of Ride unaware of what happens on next segment. Since the plan was to go to Kotagiri from coonoor and, google maps showed a shorter Route which goes to **Aravenu**.

**Coonoor** to **Aravenu** is a very beautiful route with view to waterfalls , the route itself cuts through tea estates. But surprisingly the height drops to 300m, which means one must again climb a height of 300m to reach the point from where the downhill starts. And guess what, it starts to rain heavily ,adding to the “**beauty of place**” - that’s what you say *When you are unable to ride without struggling*

As mentioned before don’t be the ***“hero in the town”,*** I took break, relaxed for more than an hour had some amazing cake and left only when I felt comfortable and confident. After Aravenu it was just handling downhill riding to Mettupalaym for next 30kms. This whole belt of 80kms Metupalaym - Coonoor - Aravenu - Mettuplayam does makes one happy, tired, and exhausted.

From this point its next 35kms to home, a bit of rolling route but okay to ride. And it became easy because met another Rider Guru, a young and fast rider who became a friend and soon will be joining for next long ride
