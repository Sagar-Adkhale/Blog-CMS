This Christmas I finally had the chance to reattempt a route which I have been trying for 2 years now. Have failed in past due to for various reasons from being overconfident to being poorly planned ride. Yet here I was again to attempt the same route.

From Technical perspective it’s a short ride just under 500km over 3 days, however with an elevation gain of 6000m. This ride touches the areas of Munar hills which don’t really get used because of its heavy inclination and deep forests. It’s good that way though.

Day 1 - Straightforward ride from Coimbatore to partial (15km) climbs of Munnar. These climbs would start after completing a ride of 200+ Kms. Unfortunately, my right knee started giving me trouble by the time I reached the foothills of Munnar. With dilemma and some Ice cubes wrapped in a bandana across my knee, I decided to ride and at least finish 10km climbs so that my next day distance does not increase a lot.

  The next day started on hills, the route which I had chosen to ride upon were some of the most silent and tribal inhabited with lot of biodiversity. The climbs were very difficult, but the presence of forests, birds and pure calmness compensated for the struggle. There was not a single section today which would be Flat. With pain in knee and little bit of icing here and there, I sustained the hills.

Eventually by evening I reached Marayoor and by that time I had made my mind to end the ride because I was just tired and exhausted. But to my surprise there was no place available to stay in marayoor and hence I decided to ride to Kanthaloor (my initial destination for day 2). I did not regret my decision. Kanthaloor is a very beautiful village with heavy movements of Elephants and nowadays tourists as well.

Eventually Mr Rajesh helped me with a tent stay in his property, amazing food and that was end of my day 2.

Day 3 was about reaching home and I decided to descend from Chinar wildlife from kerala which continues till the entrance of Amravati forests in Tamilnadu and eventually then to Udumalpettai.The 26km of downhill stretch is dense and very intimidating as if wildlife will come from anywhere. I did not record or clicked any pictures, I was purely focused on going downhill (I descended the whole hill at speed of 40-50kmph) while keeping watch for animal sightings.

It is better to ride on this route with a group or a support vehicles and one should be in really good shape
